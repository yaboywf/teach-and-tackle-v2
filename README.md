# What is this?
Teach & Tackle is a website that will allow students to input the modules they are strong in and those they find challenging. It will then enable students to filter peers who excel in the subjects they struggle with and vice versa. This allows students to pair up with peers to excel in the module that they are weak in, and allow students to guide other students in modules that they are strong in.

# What is the purpose of this website?
The purpose of the website is to facilitate peer-to-peer learning by pairing students based on their strengths and weaknesses when lecturers are temporarily unavailable. This would allow students to improve academically, and mentors being able to hone their communication and problem-solving skills, thus improving their personal growth.
